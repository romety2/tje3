<a name="ui-featured-software"></a><h4>The Featured Software Pane</h4>
<p>The Featured Software pane appears on the left side of the Update
Tool window, below the Application Images pane, when there is featured software associated with the existing application images. It displays two lists of featured software:</p>
<ul><li><p><b>Applications</b>: Applications that are complementary to applications that are already installed.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Add-ons</b>: Especially worthwhile add-ons to applications that are already installed.</p></li></ul>

<p>When you select Applications, the <b>New Applications</b> list appears on the right side of the Update Tool window just below the toolbar. The list displays the name, version, and download size of each featured application. Below the New Applications list is an area that describes the currently selected new application, provides a <b>Learn More</b> button to learn more about the application, and an <b>Install</b> button to install the application.</p>

<p>When you select Add-ons, the <b>New Add-ons</b> list appears on the right side of the Update Tool window just below the toolbar. The list displays the parent application, name, version, and download size of each featured add-on. Below the New Add-ons list is an area that describes the currently selected new add-on, provides a <b>Learn More</b> button to learn more about the add-on, and an <b>Install</b> button to install the add-on.</p>
