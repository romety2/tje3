<a name="tasks-backing-out-updates"></a><h4>To Back Out Updates</h4>

<p>"Backing out" is the process of restoring an application to the state it 
was in before an update was applied. This process consists of removing the 
package versions installed as part of the update and then installing selected 
earlier versions of those packages.<p>

<p>The most effective way to perform a back-out is to use the pkg(5) command line interface (CLI). However, before performing the back-out,  you should consult the update's 
documentation to ensure that any customizations you have made associated with the 
component will be preserved upon removal of the component and recognized
during reinstallation of the desired earlier version of the component.  Most
component removal and reinstallation processes account for preservation of
user customizations, but it is wise to read the documentation before performing
the backout process.</p>

<p>Also consider taking a backup of the entire installation image directory.
Since the installed components and many, if not all, of the associated
customizations are contained within the common installation image directory,
making a copy of the installation image directory will provide you a copy of 
the state of the installation prior to the backout process.</p>

<p>To perform a back-out using the pkg(5) command line interface (CLI), follow these steps.</p>

<ol><li><p>Use the <font face="monospace"><b>pkg history -l</b></font> command to display a detailed log of the update activities performed on the application image.</p></li>
<li><p>Look backwards through the history log for the <font face="monospace">image-update</font> operation that changed the packages you want to roll back.</p></li>
<li><p>Note down the packages that the <font face="monospace">image-update</font> operation updated. For each package, note down the old package version and the new package version. For example, the history log line</p>
<pre>pkg:/pkg-java@1.111,0-31.2172:20090608T230741Z -> pkg:/pkg-java@1.111,0-32.2220:20090703T010710Z</pre>
<p>indicates that the <font face="monospace">pkg-java</font> package was updated from version <font face="monospace">1.111,0-31.2172</font> to version <font face="monospace">1.111,0-32.2220</font>.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter a single <font face="monospace"><b>pkg uninstall</b></font> command, specifying all the packages that were updated by the <font face="monospace">image-update</font> operation. For example:</p>
<pre>$ <b>pkg uninstall pkg-java</b></pre></li>
<li><p>Enter a single <font face="monospace"><b>pkg install</b></font> command, specifying all the packages, including their <b>old</b> versions, that were updated by the <font face="monospace">image-update</font> operation. For example:</p>
<pre>$ <b>pkg install pkg-java@1.111,0-31.2172</b></pre></li>
</ol>
