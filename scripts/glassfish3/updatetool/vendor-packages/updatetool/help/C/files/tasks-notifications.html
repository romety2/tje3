<a name="tasks-notifications"></a><h4>To Act on Update Notifications</h4>
<p>If you have set Update Tool to automatically check for updates, the Update
Tool Notifier displays a notification balloon on your desktop when it determines that
one or more updates are available. When you click on the balloon, the
Software Update tool will either be started or, if it is already running, brought
to the forefront of your desktop.  If only one installation image has updates, the 
Software Update took will ask whether you want to apply the updates to that image.</p>

<p>When updates are available for more than one installation image, the Software Update
tool lists which images have updates.  Once you dismiss the dialog, you
can then select the updates for installation.</p>

<p>Whenever the Update Tool Notifier icon is shown in your desktop's notification 
area, you can right-click the icon and click "Start Software Update" to start the Software Update tool
and review and optionally apply the available updates. (On Mac OS X you do not
have this option).</p>
