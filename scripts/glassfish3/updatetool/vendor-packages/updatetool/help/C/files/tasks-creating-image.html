<a name="tasks-creating-image"></a><h4>To Create a New Installed Image</h4>
<p>When you need to create a new, empty installation image and associate it with
one or more repositories of components, you can use the New Image feature
of the Update Tool GUI. After you create an empty installation image, you can 
select add-on components from the repositories and install them into your new image.</p>
<p>
    <ol><li><p>On the toolbar, click New.</p><p>Update Tool displays the Create New Installation Image window.</p><p></p></li>
<li><p>In the Image Title box, enter a name for the installation image.</p><p>Since this name will appear in Application Images pane as the name of the installed image, try to keep the title relatively short.</p><p></p></li>
<li><p>In the Image Directory box, enter the full path to the directory that will house the image.</p><p>Alternatively, click the ... button and navigate to (and optionally create) the directory.</p><p>This is the location under which all add-on components will be installed.</p><p></p></li>
<li><p>In the Image Description box, enter an optional description for the image.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Repositories area, use the Add... button to add one or more repositories to the image.</p><p>For each repository you add, you must provide a publisher name for the repository and enter the Publisher URL of the repository.</p><p>The publisher name will appear under the "Source" column when you're viewing lists of available add-on components and updates.</p><p></p></li>
<li><p>Click OK.</p><p>Update Tool adds the image to the list in the Application Images pane, contacts the repositories, gathers the list of installable components, and displays the list under Available Add-ons.</p></li></ol>
</p>

<p>You can add multiple publisher's repositories to your installation image, but one of them must 
be marked as the preferred publisher.  Add-ons from the preferred publisher
will take precedence over the same named add-ons made available through other
publishers associated with your installation image.</p>

<p>Refer to the <a href="repositories.html">Repositories and Publishers</a> section for more
information on the preferred publisher and its impact on installing and
updating components.</p>

<p>Now you're ready to <a href="tasks-installing-add-ons.html">browse and install add-on components</a> associated with your new image.</p>
