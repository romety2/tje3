<a name="repositories"></a><h4>Repositories and Publishers</h4>
<p>An installation image is associated with one or more network 
repositories of components.  Each repository is represented by a publisher and 
an associated URL.  The publisher name is unique per installation image and 
represents both the organization or project that manages the repository and 
a well defined scope of content. The Update Tool shows the publisher in the 
"Source" column of the the component listing views.</p>

<p><b>Compatibility of Software from Multiple Repositories</b></p>
<p>When you create your own installation image or modify the list of 
repositories associated with an existing installation image, ensure that
you reference only those repositories that contain components that are compatible
with your existing software.</p>

<p>Even though you may be able to install add-ons and updates from other
repositories, the new add-ons or updates may not work properly with your 
existing software unless the organization or project that manages the 
repositories has validated those combinations.</p>

<p><b>Contents of Repositories</b></p>
<p>Each repository includes a catalog listing all of the components contained
in the repository.  The Update Tool accesses both locally maintained and 
network-based catalogs in order to list the available updates and add-ons.</p>

<p>Each component includes a manifest of the component's content.  The Update 
Tool accesses the manifest information to list installed files and other
component-specific information.</p>

<p><b>Preferred Publisher</b></p>
<p>One of the publisher's repositories associated with an installation 
image must be identified as the "preferred" publisher.  This setting helps 
the Update Tool, Software Update tool, desktop notifier and pkg command 
line interface (CLI) determine how to function when multiple publisher's 
repositories are associated with an installation image.</p>

<p>When an add-on component of the same name exists in multiple publisher's 
repositories and one of those publishers is marked as the preferred publisher, 
the Update Tool and the pkg CLI will list and install the named package from the 
preferred publisher's repository.</p>

<p>When you use the "Show Recent Versions" feature of the Update Tool or you specify
the source repository when installing the add-on via the pkg CLI, the add-on
will be installed from the source repository you have specified.</p>

<p>When a component was installed from the preferred publisher, Update Tool, 
Software Update and desktop notifier will look for updates to that component 
only from the preferred publihser.</p>

<p>When the package was installed from a non-preferred publisher, Update 
Tool, Software Update and desktop notifier only list the updates that are available from the 
repository from which the package was originally installed.</p>

<p>By default, Update Tool lists only the most recent version of each package. 
You can use the View -> Show Recent Versions command to override this behavior and list all available updates from all repositories:</p>

<p><b>Modifying List of Repositories</b></p>
<p>You can modify the list of repositories associated with an installation
image by selecting the image of interest and performing one of the following operations:</p>

<ul><li>Right click to display the context menu and select Properties...</li>
<li>Select the Edit Properties... button on the Image Details tab.</li>
<li>Select File -> Image Properties from the main menu.</li></ul>

<p><b>Local Storage of Repository Information</b></p>
<p>The list of repositories associated with an installation image as well as
local copies of catalogs and component manifests are housed under the 
directory .org.opensolaris,pkg/ within each installation image.</p>
