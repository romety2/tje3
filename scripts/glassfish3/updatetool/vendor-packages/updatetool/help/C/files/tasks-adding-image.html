<a name="tasks-adding-image"></a><h4>To Add an Existing Image to the List of Application Images</h4>
<p>In most cases, installed images are added to Update Tool as the
result of downloading and installing software. In some situations, however, you might copy an
installed image from another system for use on your system. After copying the
installed image to your system, you need to add it to the
list of installed images so that you can use Update Tool to keep
the image up to date.</p>
<ol><li><p>On the toolbar, click Open.</p><p>Update Tool displays the Choose Installation Image Directory window.</p></li>
<li><p>Navigate to the parent directory containing the installed image's directory.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the installed image's directory.</p></li>
<li><p>Click Open.</p><p>Update Tool confirms that the directory you selected contains an IPS-enabled installed image, adds the installed image to the list of images in the Application Images pane, and selects the newly added installed image.</p></li></ol>
