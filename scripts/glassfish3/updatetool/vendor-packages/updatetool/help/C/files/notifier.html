<a name="notifier"></a><h4>Desktop Notifier</h4>
<p>A background desktop notification task (or notifier) works in conjunction 
with the Update Tool to periodically check for updates and to notify you of 
updates via your desktop for all of the installation images that are known
to your installation of the Update Tool.</p>

<p><b>Registration of the Notifier</b></p>
<p>If you opt to enable automatic checking and notification of updates during
the initial installation of your image, then the notifier will be automatically
registered as a startup program in your desktop environment.</p>

<p>If an initial installation program does not register the notifier, then you can
cause the notifier to be automatically registered simply by running the 
Update Tool for at least one minute.  As long your Update Tool preferences
specify an update checking frequency other than "Never", the notifier will
be automatically registered.</p>

<p><b>Startup of the Notifier</b></p>
<p>Each time you log into your desktop, the notifier starts and runs as a 
background process. The notifier will only display in your desktop's notification
area when there are updates available for one or more of your installation images.
(The exception being on Mac OS X where the notifier is never represented in the
dock of your desktop).</p>

<p><b>Notification of Updates</b></p>
<p>When the notifier detects that updates are available, it displays an icon 
in your desktop's notification area and a window from which you can launch the 
Software Update tool to review and apply the available updates.</p>

<p>The notifier uses the list of installation images managed in your personal 
Update Tool settings to determine which images and repositories to monitor for 
updated components.  The frequency by which the notifier checks for updates is 
based on preferences set within the Update Tool. You can modify whether the
notifier check for updates at all and the frequecy at which it checks for 
updates via the Update Tool's preferences:</p>

<p>Edit -> Preferences</p>

<p><b>Operation of the Notifier</b></p>
<p>Depending on the operating system and desktop type in use, different methods
are used to register the notifier as a desktop login startup program:</p>
<ul><li>Windows: Start menu -> Programs -> Startup</li>
<li>Gnome: System -> Preferences -> Sessions -> Startup Programs -> Update Tool Desktop Notifier</li>
<li>Mac OS X: user name/Library/LaunchAgents/com.sun.ucnotifier.plist</li></ul>

<p>When you log into your desktop, a notifier startup program first consults 
the list of installation images maintained in your Update Tool 
preferences area to determine which installation image from which to launch the
notifier task.  As you install and uninstall installation images, the 
notifier startup program attempts to always use the most appropriate installation
image from which to run the notifier program.</p>

<p><b>The Notifier Interface</b></p>
