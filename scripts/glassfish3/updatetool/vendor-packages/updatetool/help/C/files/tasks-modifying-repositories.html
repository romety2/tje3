<p><b>Editing Repositories</b></p>
<p>You can modify the list of repositories associated with an installation
image and edit the settings of existing repositories by selecting the image of interest
and performing one of the following operations:</p>

<ul><li>Right click to display the context menu and select Properties...</li>
<li>Select the Edit Properties... button on the Image Details tab.</li>
<li>Select File -> Image Properties from the main menu.</li></ul>

<p><b>Enabled and Disabled Repositories</b></p>
<p>You can disable a publihser's repository entry without removing it from the list of repositories by
marking the checkbox in the Enabled column of the Image Properties. You cannot disable
the preferred publisher.</p>

<p><b>Preferred Publisher</b></p>
<p>One of the publishers' repositories associated with an image must be marked as the preferred publisher.
Add-ons from the preferred publisher will take precedence over the same named add-ons made
available through other publishers associated with your installation image.</p>

<p>Refer to the <a href="repositories.html">Repositories and Publishers</a> section for more
information on the preferred publisher and its impact on installing and
updating components.</p>

<p><b>Certificate-based Access to Repositories</b></p>
<p>When you need to access a repository that requires SSL-based communication,
you can add a client certificate and an associated client key file to a repository
entry.  Use of an https:// repository URL requires that you provide a client certificate file and
a key file.  The certificate and key files are in the .pem format and should be provided by the authority
who manages the repository.</p>
