<a name="ui-desktop-notifier"></a><h4>The Desktop Notifier Interface</h4>

<p>When the desktop notifier detects that updates are available, it displays an icon 
in your desktop's notification area and a window from which you can launch the 
Software Update tool to review and apply the available updates.</p>

<p>If you close the window, the notifier icon remains in your desktop's notification area. Clicking on the icon launches the Software Update tool.</p>

<p>For operating systems that support context menus, the notifier icon provides a context menu containing these items:</p>

<p><table border="1"><col width="20*"><col width="80*">
<tr><th align="left" valign="top" scope="column"><p><b>Menu&nbsp;Item</b></p></th>
<th align="left" valign="top" scope="column"><p><b>Description</b></p></th>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top" scope="row"><p>Show and Apply Updates</p></td>
<td align="left" valign="top" scope="row"><p>Launches the Software Update tool, from which you can select and install updates for installed application images.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top" scope="row"><p>Manage Update Details</p></td>
<td align="left" valign="top" scope="row"><p>Launches the Update Tool, from which you can select and install updates by reviewing and selecting individual packages in installed application images.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top" scope="row"><p>Preferences</p></td>
<td align="left" valign="top" scope="row"><p>Displays the Preferences window, from which you can control how often the notifier checks for updates.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top" scope="row"><p>About Update Tool Notifier</p></td>
<td align="left" valign="top" scope="row"><p><p>Displays the About Update Tool window, which lists the Update Tool version and other useful information.</p></p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top" scope="row"><p>Help</p></td>
<td align="left" valign="top" scope="row"><p>Displays the Update Tool Online Help window.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top" scope="row"><p>Exit</p></td>
<td align="left" valign="top" scope="row"><p>Exits the desktop notifier. The notifier will not run until the next time you log in to your desktop.</p></td>
</tr>
