<a name="command-line-interface"></a><h4>Command-Line Interface</h4>
<p>In addition to using the Update Tool to manage installation images, you can
use the Image Packaging System command line interface (CLI). The "pkg"
command is available under the bin/ directory of an installation image.</p>

<p>The CLI is especially useful when your system of interest is a server and
does not have a monitor and when you are remotely accessing systems to
manage installation images.</p>

<p>Virtually all of the add, update and remove operations as well as
the ability to create new installation images can be performed using the CLI.</p>

<p>Refer to the <a href="../../../../../../pkg/man/cat1/pkg.1">
pkg(1) documentation</a> for further information.  Note that Update Tool
and Image Packaging System on non-OpenSolaris platforms support management of
only "user images" as referenced in the pkg(1) documentation.</p>

<p> The <a href="../../../../../../pkg/man/cat5/pkg.5">pkg(5) man page</a>
provides further background on the Image Packaging System.</p>
