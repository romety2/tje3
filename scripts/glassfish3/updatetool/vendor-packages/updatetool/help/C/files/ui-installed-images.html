<a name="ui-installed-images"></a><h4>The Application Images Pane</h4>
<p>The Application Images pane appears on the left side of the Update
Tool window. It lists the installation images that Update Tool can manage. For each
installation image, Update Tool provides three lists:</p>
<ul><li><p><b>Available Add-ons</b>: Components of the installation image that are not yet installed.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Available Updates</b>: Updates (that is, newer versions) to components that are installed.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Installed Components</b>: Components of the installation image that are installed.</p></li></ul>

<p>Additionally, if you right-click an installation image (Control+click on 
the Macintosh), a context menu appears, offering commands that operate on 
the image.</p>

<p>Entries are added to and removed from the list of installed images in the 
following manner:</p>

<p>1) Opening and Closing Images: You can add and remove installation images
to and from the list by using the Open Image... and Close Image... features of
the Update Tool.  Opening an image will automatically add it to the list.
Closing an image will remove it from the list.</p>

<p>2) Starting Update Tool within an Image: When you start Update Tool from
within an installation image, the image will automatically be added to the 
list.</p>

<p>The list of installed images is maintained as part of your Update Tool
user preferences.  Refer to the <a href="preferences.html">Preferences</a> 
section for more information.</p>
